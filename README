This program simulates the BFS process

You should sava your initiation data of the graph in a file "input.txt". And run this program use redirect like this: BFS < input.txt
The format of "input.txt" is as follows:
n p r
node another_Node
node another_Node
......
where n is the number of nodes in the graph and the index start with 1
	  p is the number of edges in the graph and they are listed with node another_Node
	  r is the source given to the BFS process
Note: here we assume the graph is undirected
