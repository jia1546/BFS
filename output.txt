linked list representation of the graph:
1: 5 2 
2: 6 1 
3: 4 7 6 
4: 8 7 3 
5: 6 1 
6: 7 3 5 2 
7: 4 8 3 6 
8: 4 7 

1 as source node, the process of the BFS:
delete vertex: 1
   add vertex: 5
   add vertex: 2
delete vertex: 5
   add vertex: 6
delete vertex: 2
delete vertex: 6
   add vertex: 7
   add vertex: 3
delete vertex: 7
   add vertex: 4
   add vertex: 8
delete vertex: 3
delete vertex: 4
delete vertex: 8

after BFS, property of each node:
color:    1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  
distance: 0  1  3  4  1  2  3  4  
PI:      -1  1  6  7  1  5  6  7
