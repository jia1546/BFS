linked list representation of the graph:
1: 4 2 
2: 4 5 1 
3: 6 5 
4: 2 5 1 
5: 3 2 4 
6: 3 

2 as source node, the process of the BFS:
delete vertex: 2
   add vertex: 4
   add vertex: 5
   add vertex: 1
delete vertex: 4
delete vertex: 5
   add vertex: 3
delete vertex: 1
delete vertex: 3
   add vertex: 6
delete vertex: 6

after BFS, property of each node:
color:    1  1  1  1  1  1  
distance: 1  0  2  1  1  3  
PI:      2  -1  5  2  2  3
